# CI Timeout Fix - Sync Process Improvements

## Problem
The CI action for sync was failing due to timeouts at the 6-hour GitHub Actions limit. The root cause was that the `unfurl()` function calls had no timeout protection, causing the process to hang indefinitely on unresponsive websites.

## Solution
Implemented comprehensive timeout and robustness improvements:

### 1. Timeout Protection
- **unfurl() timeout**: 30 seconds per metadata fetch operation
- **Image fetch timeout**: Increased from 5s to 10s
- **Color extraction timeout**: 15 seconds
- **Overall process timeout**: 5 hours maximum (with 1 hour buffer before CI limit)

### 2. Smart Caching
- Skip recently processed items (within 24 hours) to speed up subsequent runs
- Use `--force-all` flag to override this behavior when needed for debugging

### 3. Better Error Handling
- All operations now gracefully fall back to default values instead of crashing
- Improved error messages and logging
- Progress tracking shows completion percentage every 10 items

### 4. Stability Improvements
- Reduced concurrency from 5 to 3 for better stability
- Added comprehensive fallback values for all operations
- Better resource management

## Usage

### Normal Mode (default)
```bash
npm run sync
```
- Skips items processed within the last 24 hours
- Recommended for regular CI runs

### Force Mode
```bash
node prepare.js --force-all
```
- Processes all items regardless of last update time
- Useful for debugging or full refreshes

## Expected Behavior
- Process should complete within minutes for regular runs (most items skipped)
- Full runs should complete within 1-2 hours instead of timing out
- Progress is clearly visible with percentage completion
- All errors are handled gracefully with meaningful fallback values

## Testing
The improvements have been tested to ensure:
- ✅ Timeout mechanisms work correctly
- ✅ Error handling provides graceful fallbacks
- ✅ Progress tracking is accurate
- ✅ Skip logic works as expected
- ✅ Force mode processes all items
- ✅ Output format remains consistent
